Hey y'all. Today we're gonna be doing some cool hackermans stuff.


A) Installing VScode

B) Remotely Connecting

C) Trying Some Commands


# PART A

To install on vscode, click on this here link: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

You should land on a page that looks like this:

Select either Mac or Windows because if you're putting up with Linux, you don't need my help :)

Go ahead and run the installer.exe that spawned into your downloads folder. Just speedrun through the installer and make sure to skip all the parts that ask if you'd like to install a free trial of microsoft office /j. Anyways you'll know you've done it correctly after you land at an application window that looks like this:

Congrats, you now have successfully installed vscode. And you have my blessing to move onto the next part
